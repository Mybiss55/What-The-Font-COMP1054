<h1>(Don't Fear) The Reaper</h1>
<h2>By: Blue Ã–yster Cult</h2>
</header>

<section class="verse">
All our times have come
<br>
Here but now they're gone
<br>
Seasons don't fear the reaper
<br>
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain
<br>
We can be like they are
</section>

<section class="chorus">
Come on, baby 
<br>
<span>
(don't fear the reaper)
</span>
<br>
Baby, take my hand 
<br>
<span>
(don't fear the reaper)
</span>
<br>
We'll be able to fly 
<br>
<span>
(don't fear the reaper)
</span>
<br>
Baby, I'm your man

La, la, la, la, la

Valentine is done
<br>
Here but now they're gone
<br>
Romeo and Juliet
<br>
Are together in eternity (Romeo and Juliet)
<br>
40, 000 men and women everyday (like Romeo and Juliet)
<br>
40, 000 men and women everyday (redefine happiness)
<br>
Another 40, 000 coming everyday (we can be like they are)
<br>

Love of two is one
<br>
Here but now they're gone
<br>
Came the last night of sadness
<br>
And it was clear she couldn't go on
<br>
</section>

<section class="verse">
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
<br>
The candles blew and then disappeared
<br>
The curtains flew and then he appeared
<br>
Saying don't be afraid
<br>
</section>

<section class="verse">
Come on, baby (and she had no fear)
<br>
And she ran to him (then they started to fly)
<br>
They looked backward and said goodbye (she had become like they are)
<br>
She had taken his hand (she had become like they are)
<br>
Come on, baby <span>(don't fear the reaper)</span>
